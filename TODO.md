# Zsync v0.4.0 Roadmap - The Tokio of Zig

## Vision: Next-Generation Async Runtime Following Zig's Direction

Zsync v0.4.0 will be the definitive async runtime for Zig, fully embracing Zig's colorblind async/await paradigm and new I/O interface design. We're positioning ourselves to be ahead of the curve as Zig evolves its concurrency model.

## üéØ Core Architecture Overhaul

### 1. True Colorblind Async Implementation

## üéâ Vision Statement

**Zsync v0.4.0 will be the most advanced, performant, and ergonomic async runtime in the Zig ecosystem.** We're not just following Zig's async evolution - we're leading it, providing the foundation that other Zig projects will build upon.

Our goal is to make async programming in Zig as natural as synchronous programming, while providing the performance characteristics that make Zig special. Every design decision prioritizes:

1. **Zero-cost abstractions** - Pay only for what you use
2. **Explicit control** - No hidden allocations or performance surprises  
3. **Composability** - Works seamlessly with any Zig codebase
4. **Cross-platform excellence** - Optimal performance on every target

**The future of Zig async programming starts here.** üöÄ

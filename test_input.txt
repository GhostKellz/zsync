Welcome to Zsync v0.4.0!
========================

This is a test file for the CLI example.

Zsync v0.4.0 features:
â€¢ True colorblind async/await
â€¢ Multiple execution models (blocking, thread pool, green threads)
â€¢ Vectorized I/O operations (readv/writev)
â€¢ Zero-copy optimizations (sendfile, copy_file_range)
â€¢ Platform-specific optimizations
â€¢ Future combinators (race, all, timeout)
â€¢ Cooperative cancellation
â€¢ Comprehensive metrics and monitoring

The same async code works seamlessly across all execution models!
This demonstrates the power of Zig's colorblind async paradigm.

Performance characteristics:
â€¢ Zero-allocation fast paths
â€¢ Automatic platform detection
â€¢ Kernel-space optimizations on Linux
â€¢ C-equivalent performance in blocking mode
â€¢ True parallelism with thread pools

ðŸš€ The future of Zig async programming!

## üöß Known Issues & Limitations

### **Current Blockers**
1. **Zig 0.15 Async**: Self-hosted compiler doesn't fully support async frames yet
2. **Suspend Points**: Need proper integration with reactor for async I/O
3. **Memory Management**: Frame allocation and cleanup needs work

### **Architecture Decisions**
1. **Single vs Multi-threaded**: Currently designed for single-threaded, will expand
2. **Memory Model**: Zero-copy where possible, controlled allocations
3. **API Design**: Tokio-inspired but Zig-idiomatic

### **Platform Support**
- ‚úÖ **Linux**: epoll backend implemented
- ‚úÖ **macOS/BSD**: kqueue backend implemented  
- ‚úÖ **Others**: poll fallback implemented
- ‚è≥ **Windows**: IOCP support planned
- ‚è≥ **WASI**: WebAssembly support planned
